# Speech to ASL Converter Web Application

## Introduction
The web application translates spoken language into American Sign Language (ASL) by allowing users to record or upload voice memos. These audio inputs are then converted from speech to text, which is subsequently translated into ASL, possibly through visual representations like videos or images of ASL signs.
